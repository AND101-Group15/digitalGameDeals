## App Overview

### Description 

App that provides the user with different prices of a PC game.

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Educational
- **Mobile:** This app is convenient as most wouldn't go through the trouble of going on a website to compare prices of everyday objects. However, this app allows one to search and compare average objects instantaneously.
- **Story:** The value of this app is clear as it's important to buy at the lowest price. With the state of the economy, it's more important than ever to save money wherever one can.
- **Market:** The market for this app is huge among adults as they are the ones who purchase the most items. This app could also provide value to low-income individuals/families because they are the most likely to use it to save the most money.
- **Habit:** This app can be used regularly by individuals who are on a budget. The average use would use it to create a list of objects to purchase.
- **Scope:** This app might be challenging to build because of the different mechanics of comparing prices between objects. However, we can strip this down to a certain store or to only include certain objects like technology, food, ect.
